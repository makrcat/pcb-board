### What is it?
Idk lol. The buttons on the left+right charge a capacitor, which lights up two lights! kinda like miku miku beam.
The other 3 lights are just controlled by separate buttons, respectively.

### Bill of materials
- 5 buttons (6mm tactile ones)
- 5 LEDS (5mm)
- 1 (one) 3V battery + battery holder
- 7 resistors. probably the 100 ohm ones?
- 1 capacitor
- 1 transistor
